### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Lung Cancer Survival Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict patient survival outcomes using medical history and diagnosis data.  
- **Dataset:** ~890,000 rows, 48 features (`dataset_med.csv`)  
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, XGBoost  
- **Results:** Logistic Regression and XGBoost achieved ~78% accuracy, but recall for positive cases needs improvement.  
- **Report:** [Lung_Cancer_Detection.pdf](Report/Lung_Cancer_Detection.pdf)
